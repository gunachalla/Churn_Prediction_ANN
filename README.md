# Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This code repository contains a Python script for predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.

## Background

Customer churn is a critical business challenge that many organizations face. It represents the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, leading to lost revenue and increased acquisition costs. By accurately predicting customer churn, businesses can proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies. This project aims to provide a solution by leveraging an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The model can help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention and enhance overall profitability.
## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the script:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
